!Series_summary	"RNA-seq based transcriptome profiling  allows a detailed molecular analysis of the E.coli transcriptome (~4200 genes) after perturbation with different antibiotics. Transcriptome fingerprints enable the identification of gene and pathway level responses to treatment to derive a mechanistic understanding of antibiotics mode of action and to differentiate antibiotics. For this goal, treatment has to be performed in a short time period and with sublethal concentrations of the antibiotics. Sublethal concentrations were chosen based on the EC90 concentration of the antibiotic necessary to change the cellular morphology compared to control conditions."
!Series_summary	"Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of E.coli transcriptomes after treatment with different antibiotics, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The experimental design and data analysis reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles of known and novel antibiotics. We conclude that RNA-seq based transcriptome characterization would expedite genetic network analyses and permit the dissection of complex biologic functions."
